# goloco

Goloco is a bioinformatics web application designed to enable genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function predictions with small scale experiments of 100-1000 sgRNA subsets. Our machine learning models, trained with robust compendia of genome-wide CRISPR knockout experiments, identify predictive features that capture functional relationships between related genes and they self organize into growth regulatory networks. [[1]](#1). Information leveraged by highly cross predictive nodes, i.e. lossy compressed subsets of 100-1000 genes, in these networks can make previously insurmountable experiments possible by generating genome-scale portraits of growth regulation captured with tiny pools of hundreds of sgRNAs. With this tool we hope to make functional genomic inquiry more effiecient and scalable.
